= ROpenLaszlo Interface to the OpenLaszlo Platform

ROpenLaszo is a Ruby interface to the OpenLaszlo[http://openlaszlo.org] platform for creating rich internet applicatons.  It allows you to compile OpenLaszlo[http://openlaszlo.org] programs from within Ruby, in order to integrate OpenLaszlo[http://openlaszlo.org] development into Rake or Rails applications.

OpenLaszlo[http://openlaszlo.org] programs are written in XML with embedded JavaScript, and compiled into Flash (swf) binary files, or DHTML.  (As of this writing, the DHTML target is in pre-beta form.)  The APIs in this library make it easy for Ruby code to invoke the OpenLaszlo[http://openlaszlo.org] compiler.  For example, if hello.lzx contains the following text:
  <canvas>
    <window>
      <button>Hello, World!</button>
    </window>
  </canvas>
then the following Ruby code can be used to create a file 'hello.swf' which can be executed in a browser or placed on a web site:
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'ropenlaszlo'
  OpenLaszlo::compile 'hello.lzx'

== Requirements

* {OpenLaszlo 3.1}[http://openlaszlo.org]
 * Ruby -v 1.8.2 or later (untested in earlier versions)

== Downloading and Installation

ROpenLaszlo is distributed as a RubyGem.  You may download it from ROpenLaszlo's RubyForge project[http://rubyforge.org/projects/ropenlaszlo].

Installation of ROpenLaszlo requires that you have RubyGems[http://rubygems.rubyforge.org] installed.  In that case, you can download the ROpenLaszlo .gem to your local file system, and execute:

  gem install ropenlaszlo

== Documentation

http://weblog.openlaszlo.org/archives/2006/01/deploying-openlaszlo-applications-with-rake/ has additional information and some examples of using ROpenLaszlo in a Rakefile.  (Where that entry says to download 'openlaszlo.rb' and require 'openlaszlo', you should instead install this ropenlaszlo gem and require 'ropenlaszlo'.)
